This file is a simple log of experiments I have done with the SoX trimming
utility. Once we have smoothed out the process, we need to update our scripts
to do it automatically.

SAMPLE 1: Bach Cello Suite
TOTAL DURATION BEFORE: 18:17.06

COMMAND: sox sox-test_mixdown.wav trimmed_mixdown.wav silence -l 1 0.1 1% -1 2.0 1%
TOTAL DURATION AFTER: 17:53.52

COMMAND: sox sox-test_mixdown.wav trimmed_mixdown.wav silence -l 1 0.1 1% -1 4.0 1%
TOTAL DURATION AFTER: 18:06.873

Garbage at the end

SAMPLE 2: Irene Auger sampler
TOTAL DURATION BEFORE: 7:54.65


COMMAND: sox auger-sampler_mixdown.wav trimmed_mixdown.wav silence -l 1 0.1 1% -1 4.0 1%
TOTAL DURATION AFTER: 5:02.03

Still had garbage at end

VERY GOOD RESULTS WITH THIS: sox vivaldi-sample_mixdown.wav trimmed-vivaldi-mixdown.wav silence -l 1 4.0 -96d -1 4.0 -6d
